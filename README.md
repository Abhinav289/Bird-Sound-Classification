# Bird-Sound-Classification

Inference_from_Efficient_BO:\\
This notebook runs inference on BirdCLEF 2025 test soundscapes and generates a submission file. It supports both single model inference and ensemble inference with multiple models.\\

Audio_to_melspec:\\
Pre-processing (Extracting time and frequency features from audio files)\\

EfficientNet_B0_Pytorch_[Train]:\\
